    <p>
        Warrior Robotics is an <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">FRC</a> team of roughly 30 students based in Sudbury Massachusetts. FRC is a robotics competition, similar to battle bots, where teams compete to build the best robot to complete a challenge. Every year, we build a new bot and compete against over a hundred other teams around the New England district. I’ve been a member of Warrior Robotics since 2018.

        Our team is split into 4 sub-teams. Design, Mechanical, Electrical, and Software. I’ve been on the software team since the 2018-2019 school year. As of the 2020-2021 school year, I’ve been appointed the head of the software team. We program the robot in Java using Visual Studio Code, and WPILib. As of the 2019-2020 school year, I was also appointed as one of the team's 2 drivers, meaning that I help to control the robot during matches.

        Our team also participates in various outreach programs around our community. One of these events is our yearly “repair cafe” where we fix community members devices for free. We also bring our robot to the local library, where we show kids how it works, and even let them drive it. We also run 4 <a href="https://www.firstlegoleague.org/" target="_blank">FLL</a> teams at Curtis Middle School, where we get kids interested in STEM through this smaller version of our competitions. After graduating middle school, many of these kids go on to become members of our high school team! I was a member of these middle school teams for all 3 years of middle school. I was also a member of another FLL team at my elementary school for 2 years, which was not associated with Warrior Robotics.

        Every year, we make a presentation, along with a short video, that we present to the judges at our competition about these programs in something called the “chairman's presentation”. Every year I’ve been incharge of filming and editing the video portion of this presentation. As of my sophomore year, I’ve also been one of the presenters.
